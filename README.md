Kaiju Big Battel Website Reimagining by John Torres  


1) Sitename: Kaiju Big Battel â€“ URL: [www.kaiju.com](http://www.kaiju.com)
(domain name already owned by company)  
  
2) Purpose/Goals - Kaiju Big Battel provided the inspiration
to try my hand at creating a website of my own that they might be able to utilize.  Even if they decided not to use it as their company site, it could still be deployed as a fansite.  
  
3) Intended Audience - Professional wrestling fans, Kaiju Big Battel fans, fans of monster films  


The Home page (index.html) will contain results from the last events and information about the current stories being told from event to event.
  
The About (about.html) page itself will go into detail about the war between good vs. evil and a few of the major players on each side, current events within the story, and a table listing upcoming events.  
 
The Login (login.html) and Register (register.html) features would be aimed at joining the fictitious Kaiju Big Battel Fighto Club.

The Interact (interact.html) feature would act as a portal for a fictitious fan club entitled the Kaiju Big Battel Fighto Club, or KBB FC.  This interact page would be where members go to purchase exclusive presale tickets.
  
The History (history.html) page would go into greater depth about the results history of Kaiju Big Battel, with buttons that assist in navigating to a specific year, and a button at the bottom of the page that would return you to the top.
  
The site will be responsive across all screen sizes.
