Kaiju Big Battel Website Reimagining by John Torres  


1) Sitename: Kaiju Big Battel – URL: [www.kaiju.com](http://www.kaiju.com)
(domain name already owned by company)  
  
2) Purpose/Goals - Kaiju Big Battel provided the inspiration
to try my hand at creating a website of my own that they might be able to utilize.  Even if they decided not to use it as their company site, it could still be deployed as a fansite.  
  
3) Intended Audience - Professional wrestling fans, Kaiju Big Battel fans, fans of monster films  


The Home page (index.html) will contain results from the last event and information about the next event.
  
The About (about.html) page itself will go into greater detail about the company, current events within the story, and upcoming events.  There will be an abbreviated About summary on the Home page as well.  
 
The Login (login.html) and Register (register.html) features would be aimed at “joining the Kaiju Big Battel Fan Club" (working title, does not actually exist).

The Interact (interact.html) feature would act as a sort of base or HQ for those that login, with information about upcoming KBB activities along with KBB FC-exclusive activities.  
  
The History (history.html) page would go into greater depth about the storyline past of Kaiju Big Battel and how it came to be.  
  
The site will be responsive across all screen sizes.
