                    <h2>Who Will Save The World?</h2>
                    <p>Shwaaa! The Heroes are here to save the world from the evil forces of Kaiju Big Battel. Call for help and the Heroes emerge, ready to defend the world against the danger of ugly alien beasts and metropolis-smashing monsters. Although
                        many Kaiju heroes lead ordinary lives when not fighting evil, they quickly transform themselves into superheroes when cities need protection.

                        <br><br>The ever-popular <strong>American Beetle</strong> is always the first to standup to any of Kaiju Big Battel's vast array of evil-doers. Truly a bug of the people, American Beetle makes it a habit of cruising towards the
                        Kaiju Ring through the audience, gathering momentum through the adulation of his supporters. It is only a matter of time before Beetle turns his sights on the Kaiju Grand Championship!

                        <br><br>The oldest Kaiju in history, <strong>Dusto Bunny</strong> brings a cloud of dust and a mean right hook everywhere he travels. Kaiju Big Battel nearly lost Dusto Bunny to the nefariousness of Dr. Cube before the then-Kaiju
                        Grand Champion Powa Ranjuru came to the rescue and assisted in resurrecting the most tenured member of the roster. Dusto now yearns for revenge, and Cube and co. have to be watching their backs.

                        <br><br>Possibly the greatest tag team in all of Kaiju history (don't tell the Bodega Boyz we said that), <strong>Los Plantanos</strong> suffered a setback recently when Pablo Plantain had his stem violently torn from his head.
                        Now on his own, Paco has declared war on Dr. Cube's posse, and will stop at nothing to avenge his fallen brother. After emerging victorious in Pittsburgh against #13, who will Paco set his sights on next?

                        <br><br>The Heroes of Kaiju have their sights set on wresting power away from Double Unicorn Dark and Dr. Cube, although the odds are very much stacked against them. Who will step into the forefront at the one who will take the
                        Kaiju Grand Championship away from Double Unicorn Dark? Only time will tell.</p>

                    <h2>Perpetual Peril At The Hands Of The Posse!</h2>
                    <p>Danger can happen! Dr. Cube's Posse is the evilest evil within Kaiju Big Battel. Heading up this clearinghouse of wickedness is the misanthropic mad scientist, Dr. Cube. Cube's three-step plan to self-actualization includes world domination
                        by means of genetic modification, financial crime, and terrorizing mankind with his giant, city-crushing monsters.

                        <br><br>The diabolical <strong>Dr. Cube</strong> has terrorized Kaiju Big Battel since its inception. However, with the emergence of Unicorn Party's evil brother, Double Unicorn Dark, it is now Dr. Cube's turn to be the one in
                        terror. Double Unicorn Dark has highjacked Cube's posse, and even forced Cube to lay down and surrender his newly won Kaiju Grand Championship to Double Unicorn Dark. How long will Dr. Cube remain under the thumb of D.U.D.?

                        <br><br>A very evil primate with some very spicy sauce, <strong>Hell Monkey</strong> is one of Cube's longest tenured henchmen. Now under the employ of D.U.D., Hell Monkey's reign of terror continues, while his hot sauce continues
                        to fly off the shelves of Kaiju Merchandise Stands worldwide. If the financial success continues, will Hell Monkey continue playing second banana to Cube and D.U.D.?

                        <br><br>After 10 years, <strong>Gomi-Man</strong>, God of Trash, has risen. With tentacles and garbage in tow, Gomi-Man wasted no time making its presence known, laying waste to Steam-Powered Tentacle Boulder before running interference
                        for Dr. Cube, leading to the downfall of Powa Ranjuru and the subsequent uprising of Double Unicorn Dark. Will the God of Trash remain loyal to D.U.D.?

                        <br><br>As it stands, the Posse are in firm control of the Kaiju Big Battel universe. Double Unicorn Dark is in firm control of the Kaiju Grand Championship, as well as in control of Dr. Cube. Is this the end of Kaiju Big Battel
                        as we know it? Is there a hero that can stand up to D.U.D. and his forces?</p>
